                            An ex-professional Barista turned programmer, on the weekends I like to hurls discs of plastic through a field towards a basket (Disc Golf) and sit in front of another screen for hours screaming (console gaming).

                            Initially I attended Berry College in Rome, Georgia and recieved a bachelors degree in Marketing. After graduation I began working in a small independant coffee shop and really loving the work I was doing there. That job turned into another and the ability to go to the Counter Culture Training Studio to receive my Professional Certifications. Over the two years while I was reciving formal training I also started competing in Brewing Competitions as well as Barista Competitions. I stayed in the specialty coffe industry until in September of 2017 when the last shop I worked at closed its doors for good.

                            I took the event of losing my job as an opportunity to be able to finally change my career path into something that I could be excited about as well as have the comfort of job security (the average salary does's hurt either!). But here I am regardless, driving myself crazy with this incredible opportunity.
